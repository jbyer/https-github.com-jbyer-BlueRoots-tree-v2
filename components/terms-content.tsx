        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Payment Processing</h3>

        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Donor Eligibility</h3>

          compliance efforts.

        <h3>5.4 Reporting</h3>
        <p>
          Political Pay will provide Campaigns with the information necessary to comply with reporting requirements, but

          authorities.
        </p>

        <h3>5.5 Prohibited Sources</h3>

          contractors, or corporations (where applicable), are not permitted. Political Pay reserves the right to reject
          or refund any contribution that appears to come from a prohibited source.
